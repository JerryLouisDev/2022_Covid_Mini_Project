Hack Diversity 2022: Software Engineer Tech Drive

Project Summary & Goal
One of the tools used by doctors to assess the condition 
of patients with COVID-19 is an x-ray, which creates an 
image of the patient’s organs and structures within their body.
This can help visualize infections such as pneumonia within 
a patient’s lungs. With this in mind, your task is to create 
a web application that allows doctors to submit structured 
radiology reports (assessments of x-ray images) for exams 
of patients with COVID-19. This application will allow 
staff to review patient trends, update exam information,
and view patient history.

Requirements
Your group should take some time up front to plan out how you will approach the project and divide up the work. You can use Figma to design the user interface for the site.

Your web application should contain three pages:
A main (or “index”) page that allows users to view all of the exam records in the database.
An administration page (no need to add authentication) that allows users to add new exam records and edit values for existing exam records.
A detail page that displays all of the information for a given exam, including a larger image of the chest x-ray.

In order to support the building of this application, you’ll need to work on several different tasks. Some of these can be done in parallel, meaning you can work on multiple at the same time.
Set up your code repository, using the skeleton we have provided for you. 
Finalize the data model you want to use and create the required tables in the database.
Build the server-side APIs for providing data to the client (the web pages themselves).
Build the server-side APIs for creating and updating records.
Build the front end/client pages for viewing and adjusting information.

You should also deploy your website to Heroku so that it's available via a public URL.
